# This a module developed by Jean Paul (A software Engineer)
# His main purpose was to put almost all datas tructures and their algorithms in one module --
# To simplify life for himself and other programmers who might be interested to use this module.

# Data structures that are in here are like:
                # Stack
                # Queue
                # Linked list as LList:
                            # Singly Linked List
                            # Singly circular Linked List
                            # Doubly Linked List
                            # Doubly Circular Linked List
                            
                # Graphs:
                            # DFS(Depth First Search)
                            # BFS(Breadth First Search)
                        
                        
# The module also contains some useful functions used in every day coding jobs
            # power(a,b), a to the power of b
            # revString(string), reversing a string
            # fib(number), fibonacci serie number of a given order (number)
            # fact(number), factorial of a number
            # isEven(number), return True if number is even , otherwise returns False
            # isOdd(number), return True if number is odd, otherwise False
            # isPrime(number), return True if number is prime number, otherwise False
            # isPalindrome(string), return True if a string is palindrome, otherwise false
            # isAnagram(string1,string2), return True if string1 is anagram of string2 (string1 is formed by rearranging string2)
